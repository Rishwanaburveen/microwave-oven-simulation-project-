<h2>Embedded system:</h2>

》Any combination of Hardware and Software which is intended to do a Specific Task can be called as an Embedded System.
<br/>
》A General purpose system is used to perform large number of tasks whereas an Embedded system is used to perform a specific task.

<h2>Microwave oven:</h2>

》Microwave oven is used to heat the food using Microwaves which is a form of electromagnetic waves.
<br/>
》There are several modes in microwave oven 
     <ul>
        <li>Micro mode</li>
        <li>Grill mode</li>
        <li>Convection mode</li>
        <li>Start mode</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>MPLAB IDE</li>
       <li>XC8 Compiler</li>
       <li>PICSimlab</li>
            <ol>
               <li>PIC16F877A</li>
               <li>16 × 4 CLCD</li>
               <li>Tactile Switch</li>
               <li>Matrix keypad</li>
               <li>Timer Module</li>
               <li>Fan module</li>
           </ol>
   </ul>

<h2>Project working:</h2>

Build hex file in mplab × ide software and compile using MPLAB XC8 then in picsim lab software load the hex file in Board-pic genios board/Microcontroller-PIC16F877A.
